## Overview

This is a badly copied over soundgasm.net mirror, with simulation of loading times/views/form submissions compared to the actual site. However it should work for local safekeeping or whatever. When building locally, change `baseurl: '/soundgasm.net-jerkyll-mirror'` in `_config.yml` to your custom baseurl, typically its just empty.

You can look over all the html files in the root and `/u/`, `/passwordreset/`, as they are all just custom coded templates that I copied over and modified. In particular, `index.html` on the root is changed to display all users.

`/assets/` contains all the website css, images, js whatever, ideally don't change that. what
